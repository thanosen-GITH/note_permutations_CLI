# Safety & Limits

## Combinatorial explosion

Permutation counts grow extremely fast.

High note counts can:
- Produce massive files
- Consume large amounts of disk space
- Take minutes or hours to complete

## Recommendations

- Start with small note counts
- Verify available disk space before large runs
- Avoid running maximum permutations unintentionally
