# Overview

**note_permutations_CLI** generates all ordered permutations of musical notes.

Given a number of notes (1–12), the program enumerates every possible permutation and exports the results as:

- Text files
- MIDI files (chordal, melodic, or both)

## What this tool is for

- Exploring harmonic and melodic possibilities
- Studying combinatorics in music
- Generating raw material for composition or analysis
- Exhaustive enumeration of pitch-order sets

## What this tool is not

- Not a DAW or sequencer
- Not a real-time MIDI generator
- Not optimized for interactive browsing (yet)
